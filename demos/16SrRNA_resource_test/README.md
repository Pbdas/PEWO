# PEWO demo nÂ°2 : Resource evaluation

## Overview

This demo measures CPU/RAM/TIME resources consumed by the different
placement softwares, using a reference dataset of 16S-rRNA barcodes.

EPA-ng, PPlacer, RAPPAS are tested.
Each measure is repeated 3 times.
This analysis will require around 4 hours of computation.

Final measures are reported as the mean of the repeats.
Consequently, increasing repeats should improve the evaluation.

## How to launch

Download pipeline.
```
git clone https://github.com/blinard-BIOINFO/PEWO_workflow.git 
cd PEWO_workflow
```

Install PEWO environment (may take some time...).
```
conda env create -f envs/environement.yaml
```

Load environement.
```
conda activate PEWO
```

Test workflow before launch.
```
snakemake -np \
--snakefile eval_resources.smk \
--config workdir=$(pwd)/demos/16SrRNA_resource_test/run \
query_user=`pwd`/demos/16SrRNA_resource_test/EMP_92_studies_100000.fas \
--configfile demos/16SrRNA_accuracy_test/config.yaml
```

Execute workflow, using 4 CPU cores.
```
snakemake -p --cores 4 \
--snakefile eval_resources.smk \
--config workdir=$(pwd)/demos/16SrRNA_resource_test/run \
query_user=`pwd`/demos/16SrRNA_resource_test/EMP_92_studies_100000.fas \
--configfile demos/16SrRNA_resource_test/config.yaml
```

## Comments

In this example, 'workdir' and 'query_user' config flags are set
dynamically, as it is required they are passed as absolute paths.
You could also set them manually by editing the config.yaml file
before launch.
