Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 29 of /home/ben/PycharmProjects/placetest_pipeline/tools/hmmer_alignment.smk:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
HMM/1_r300.psiblast
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
